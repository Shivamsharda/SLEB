# üéµ Binaural Beats Screen Flasher

A Python-based GUI application that synchronizes fullscreen visual flashing with binaural beats audio frequencies. The app can automatically detect binaural beat frequencies in real-time or flash at a user-defined static frequency.

## ‚ú® Features

- üéß **Audio Playback**: Plays your binaural beats audio while flashing
- üîÑ **Auto-Detection Mode**: Automatically detects binaural frequency from stereo audio and adjusts flashing dynamically
- üéØ **Manual Mode**: Set a static frequency (0.5-40 Hz) for consistent flashing
- üñ•Ô∏è **Fullscreen Experience**: Pure white/black flashing covers entire screen
- ‚å®Ô∏è **ESC Key Control**: Quick exit from fullscreen mode
- üìä **Real-time Frequency Display**: See current frequency being used
- üé® **User-Friendly Interface**: Clean, modern GUI with status updates

## üé¨ How It Works

### Auto-Detect Mode
1. Analyzes stereo audio in 2-second chunks
2. Detects binaural frequency by examining the difference between left and right channels
3. Dynamically adjusts screen flash rate as frequency changes
4. Example: If audio has 10Hz for 30 minutes then switches to 4Hz, the flashing automatically adjusts

### Manual Mode
1. User sets desired frequency (0.5-40 Hz)
2. Screen flashes at that exact rate throughout audio playback
3. Perfect for testing specific frequencies or using with mono audio

## üìã Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Audio file in supported format (WAV, MP3, OGG, FLAC)
- For auto-detection: **Stereo audio file** with binaural beats

## üöÄ Installation

### Step 1: Clone or Download

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Shivamsharda/SLEB.git
cd binaural-beats-flasher
```

### Step 2: Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install numpy librosa soundfile scipy pygame
```

Or use requirements.txt:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Requirements File Contents
Create a `requirements.txt` file with:
```
numpy>=1.20.0
librosa>=0.9.0
soundfile>=0.10.0
scipy>=1.7.0
pygame>=2.0.0
```

## üíª Usage

### Running the Application

```bash
python binaural_flasher.py
```

### Auto-Detect Mode (Recommended for Binaural Beats)

1. **Select Mode**: Choose "Auto-Detect Frequency" (default)
2. **Load Audio**: Click "Browse Audio File" and select your stereo binaural beats file
3. **Start**: Click the "‚ñ∂ Start" button
4. **Experience**: Main window hides, fullscreen flashing begins with audio playback
5. **Stop**: Press **ESC** key anytime to return to control panel

**Note**: Auto-detect mode requires **stereo audio** files with actual binaural beats (different frequencies in left/right channels).

### Manual Mode (Static Frequency)

1. **Select Mode**: Choose "Manual Frequency"
2. **Set Frequency**: Enter desired frequency in Hz (0.5 - 40)
   - **Delta waves**: 0.5-4 Hz (deep sleep)
   - **Theta waves**: 4-8 Hz (meditation)
   - **Alpha waves**: 8-13 Hz (relaxation)
   - **Beta waves**: 13-30 Hz (focus)
   - **Gamma waves**: 30-40 Hz (cognitive enhancement)
3. **Load Audio**: Select any audio file (can be mono or stereo)
4. **Start**: Click "‚ñ∂ Start"
5. **Stop**: Press **ESC** key to exit

## üéØ Use Cases

- **Meditation & Relaxation**: Use theta/alpha frequencies for deep relaxation
- **Focus & Study**: Beta frequencies for enhanced concentration
- **Sleep Aid**: Delta frequencies for better sleep
- **Brainwave Entrainment**: Synchronize visual and auditory stimuli
- **Research**: Test effects of different frequencies

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

### Health & Safety

- **Photosensitive Epilepsy Warning**: This application uses rapid screen flashing that may trigger seizures in people with photosensitive epilepsy. Do NOT use if you have epilepsy or are sensitive to flashing lights.
- **Start Slow**: Begin with lower frequencies and shorter sessions
- **Take Breaks**: Do not use for extended periods without rest
- **Consult Healthcare Provider**: If you have any medical conditions, consult a doctor before use

### Technical Notes

- **Stereo Required for Auto-Detection**: Auto-detect mode needs stereo audio with genuine binaural beats
- **Frequency Range**: Limited to 0.5-40 Hz for safety and effectiveness
- **Screen Refresh**: Flashing accuracy depends on your monitor's refresh rate
- **Audio Formats**: Supports WAV, MP3, OGG, and FLAC files

## üîß Troubleshooting

### "Audio file is mono" Warning
**Solution**: Use Manual Mode or convert audio to stereo with actual binaural beats in left/right channels

### Audio Not Playing
**Solution**: 
- Ensure pygame mixer is properly installed: `pip install --upgrade pygame`
- Check that audio file format is supported
- Verify audio file is not corrupted

### Flashing Seems Irregular
**Solution**:
- Lower frequencies (< 2 Hz) may appear irregular due to long periods
- Ensure system isn't under heavy load
- Close other applications using significant resources

### ESC Key Not Working
**Solution**:
- Click on the fullscreen window to ensure it has focus
- Wait for application to fully load before pressing ESC
- If stuck, use Alt+Tab (Windows/Linux) or Cmd+Tab (Mac) to switch windows

## üìä Technical Details

### Frequency Detection Algorithm
- Uses Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) on channel difference signal
- Analyzes 2-second audio chunks for real-time detection
- Focuses on 0.5-40 Hz range (binaural beats frequency spectrum)
- Identifies peak frequency in the spectrum

### Flashing Mechanism
- Calculates period from frequency: `period = 1/frequency`
- Alternates between white and black at half-period intervals
- Uses threading for smooth audio playback and visual rendering
- Fullscreen tkinter window for distraction-free experience
